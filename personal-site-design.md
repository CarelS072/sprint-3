What is you site's primary purpose?

It will be my portfolio showing what I have done and what I am capable of

Who is your target audience?

Other developers, employers

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want to give visitors the impression how I organise my work, in terms of interaction: not too many levels deep and a proper mobile design responsiveness.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Using wireframing, boxifying design and through trial and error. Ultimately I want to add more (subtle) ineractiveness and keep an eye on it's "performance budget", my assumption is that the latter will become more apparent in later sprints (Sep-2018).
For the mobile friendly design part of it I want to make use of the @media syntax in CSS and use the -em as units to ensure everything is at scale to one another.
For text I want to stay below 75 characters per line which is around 28em
